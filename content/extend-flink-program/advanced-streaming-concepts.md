You can learn about advanced streaming concepts and how they are implemented in Apache Flink from the [Flink documentation](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/dev/datastream_api.html). If you are attending an AWS hosted event, we will cover topics like, event time, watermarks, time windows, and processing semantics in a presentation.
